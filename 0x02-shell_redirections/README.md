echo "Ôo"
This command uses the echo command to display the text "Ôo" in the terminal window. The echo command is used to print text to the standard output, which is typically the terminal window.

cat /etc/passwd
This command uses the cat command to display the contents of the /etc/passwd file in the terminal window. The cat command is used to concatenate and display the contents of one or more files.

#!/bin/bash
This line is called a "shebang" and specifies the interpreter that should be used to run the script. In this case, it specifies that the script should be run using the Bash shell.

chmod +x display_passwd.sh
This command uses the chmod command to modify the permissions of the display_passwd.sh script. The +x argument sets the executable bit for the file, which allows it to be run as a script.

./display_passwd.sh
This command runs the display_passwd.sh script in the current directory. The ./ specifies the current directory as the location of the script.

cat /etc/passwd && echo "Contents of /etc/hosts:" && cat /etc/hosts
This command displays the contents of both the /etc/passwd and /etc/hosts files in the terminal window. The && operator is used to execute each command sequentially, so the script will first display the contents of /etc/passwd, then print a message indicating that it is displaying the contents of /etc/hosts, and finally display the contents of /etc/hosts.

cat /etc/passwd ; echo "Contents of /etc/hosts:" ; cat /etc/hosts
This command also displays the contents of both the /etc/passwd and /etc/hosts files in the terminal window, but uses the semicolon (;) operator to execute each command sequentially instead of &&. The script will first display the contents of /etc/passwd, then print a message indicating that it is displaying the contents of /etc/hosts, and finally display the contents of /etc/hosts.
